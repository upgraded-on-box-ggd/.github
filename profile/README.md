However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the Mo𝚟ie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the Strea𝚖ing platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.
